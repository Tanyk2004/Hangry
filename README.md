<h2>A shopping list app that labels products based on sustainability and then suggests alternatives.</h2>

## Idea: 

  A shopping list app that suggests sustainable alternatives for any grocery item you add. For the new item suggested, the user can either choose to accept or reject. To help with the decision making, we offer information like price, CO2 reduction, and vendors that have the product nearby. 
  
  Our goal is to address the issue of sustainabiltiy right as the users are making the decision of what they need to buy.
